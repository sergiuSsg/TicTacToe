# TicTacToe
Tic Tac Toe - React.Js

Tic Tac Toe is created with the use of React.I have made multiple changes to how a normal tic-tac-toe would look and work. Some of them are: I created Modals for the easy choice of player at the beginning and for the end of every round where is showing how that round ended(Who won or if it was a draw). Also the score is shown which updates as soon as X or O wins the game and is shown in the modal in the draw and win cases. The game also has the restart button(which resets the score and the progress on board) while playing or shown as well in the modal.


While creating this, I made use of some of the following features of React and others:
-Children
-Props
-Hooks(useEffect, useState)
-CSS styling with CSS Grid
-React Modal
-JSX syntax
