Tic Tac Toe - React.Js



Tic Tac Toe is created with the use of React. I have made some changes to how a normal tic-tac-toe would look and work. Some of them are: I created Modals for the easy choice of player(X or O) at the beginning and also for the end of every round(Won or a Draw). Also the score updates as soon as X or O wins the game and is shown under the game board and in the modal(draw and win cases). The game also has the restart button(which resets the score and the progress on board) while playing, or is shown as well in the modal. Lastly under board there is a H2 element which shows who's turn is next.


While creating this, I made use of some of the following features of React and others:
-Reusable Components
-Children
-Props
-Hooks(useEffect, useState)
-CSS styling with CSS Grid
-React Modal
-JSX syntax
